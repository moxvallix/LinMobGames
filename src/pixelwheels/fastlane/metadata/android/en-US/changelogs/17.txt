Did a lot of work on the graphics: darker roads, new trees, new city roofs, textured sidewalks, nicer bridge borders, rounder sand tiles.

For consistency, made all menu buttons ALL CAPS.

Show "Restart" button first in quick race mode.

Added an "About" tab to the configuration screen.

Fixed noise on map tiles.
