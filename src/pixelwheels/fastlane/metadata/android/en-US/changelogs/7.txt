- Championships! A first rough version of championships has been added: since there are 4 tracks in Pixel Wheels at the moment, they have been grouped in 2 championships of 2 tracks each.
- The volumes of the sound effects have been adjusted to avoid cacophony.
- There is now a 3 second countdown at the start of each race.
- In score tables, player rows now use different colors.
