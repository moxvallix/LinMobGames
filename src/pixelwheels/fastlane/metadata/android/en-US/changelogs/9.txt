- New bonus: the homing missile!
- Enabled gamepad support on Android.
- Camera does not rotate to follow player vehicle anymore.
- Improved touch control.
- Bonus crates are bigger now, making them easier to grab.
- Reduced turbo and maximum speed a bit.
- You can now destroy mines (and missiles!) using the gun. This also means that when you picked a mine bonus but you haven't dropped it yet, it can protect you from one gun bullet or missile.
